        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="http://chrismcnamara.org">Chris McNamara Media</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>Hello I'm Chris! I'm a digital media professional by trade and a fun loving goof-ball by choice.
          I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Journalism, emphasizing digital media production.
          I am an avid photographer and cinematographer, experienced marketing and social media professional, and growing learner
          in the field of web development and coding.<br /><br />

          In my free time I enjoy exploring the outdoors and living an active life style via wellness training
          find great joy in words and reading, and do my best to continue improving myself internally and externally.<br /><br />

          This site is a begginer project on my journey in the world of Web Development and the foundational coding
          experience. While it appears a bit crude for the time being progress is never instant nor easy and hope I can
          the new skills I gain along the way to polish it up and improve its funtioning.
